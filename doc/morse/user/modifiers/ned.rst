NED conversion
==============

This modifier converts the coordinates generated by the MORSE simulator to
change to the North, East, Down (NED) coordinate system, instead of the East,
North, Up (ENU) system normally used by Blender.

This is achieved by switching the direction of the X and Y axis, as well as
inverting the sense of the Z axis.

Modified data
-------------

Modifiers work over a dictionary called ``local_data`` of the components.
The names of the variables affected are the following:

- **x**: X coordinate of the component
- **y**: Y coordinate of the component
- **z**: Z coordinate of the component

- **yaw**: rotation around the local Z axis
- **pitch**: rotation around the local Y axis
- **roll**: rotation around the local X axis
