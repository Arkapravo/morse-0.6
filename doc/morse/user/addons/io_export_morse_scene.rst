Export MORSE scene as Python Builder script
===========================================

This add-on is accessible from the ``File>Export>Save MORSE scene(.py)`` menu.

This option will only be available for MORSE scenes, that is, only if the
script finds the **Scene_Script_Holder** object in the scene.


When executed, it will generate a file with the same name as the ``.blend`` file,
but will change the extension to ``.py``. This file will be placed in the same
directory from which MORSE was started.
