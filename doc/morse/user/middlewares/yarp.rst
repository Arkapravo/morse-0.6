YARP
====

The YARP middleware provides a simple method to share data across components in
different computers. It is based on the concept of *ports*, which are
registered in a *name server* to differentiate between separate channels of
communication.

Data is shared in the format of bottles, which are nested data structures of
various data types.

.. note:: Port names used in MORSE have the following format:
  ``/ors/robots/[robot_name]/[component_name]/[direction]``. The term [direction]
  is either ``in`` or ``out``, depending on the type of component being actuator
  or sensor, respectively.

Files
-----

- Python: ``$MORSE_ROOT/src/morse/modifiers/yarp_mw.py``

Available methods
-----------------

- ``read_message``: Gets information from a port, and stores it in the
  ``local_data`` dictionary of the associated component. This method is only able
  to handle data of types: integer, float and string.  
- ``post_message``: Formats the contents of ``local_data`` into a bottle,
  and sends it through the port associated with a component. This method is
  only able to handle data of types: integer, float and string.
- ``post_image_RGBA``: (Requires YARP version 2.5+) Sends an image through a
  specialised port. The image must be stored in ``local_data`` as a binary
  string with 32bit pixels encoded as RGBA. The actual size of the image is
  read directly from the component instance that called this method.


Available extensions
--------------------

These files contain additional methods that can be used with the YARP middleware.
To use them, it is necessary to list the file as the third element of the middleware
list, in the ``component_config.py`` script, as described in the :doc:`hooks <../hooks>`
documentation.

- Json modifier: Stored in the file: ``$MORSE_ROOT/src/morse/middleware/yarp/json_mod.py``.
  It has two available methods:

    - ``post_json_message``: Change the ``local_data`` into a single string and send it
    - ``read_json_message``: Read a string and expand the contents into the ``local_data``
      dictionary

- SICK sensor: Stored in the file: ``$MORSE_ROOT/src/morse/middleware/yarp/sick.py``.
  It has one available methods:

    - ``post_sick_message``: Store the list of points in ``local_data`` as a
      collection of nested bottles and writes them to a port

- Semantic camera: Stored in the file: ``$MORSE_ROOT/src/morse/middleware/yarp/dictionary.py``.
  It has one available methods:

    - ``post_dictionary_data``: Store the dictionary in the ``visible_objects``
      item of ``local_data`` as a collection of nested pairs of bottles storing
      the name and value of the dictionary


Service interface
-----------------

MORSE components providing :doc:`services <../../dev/services>` can expose this interface using YARP ports.

.. note:: Services handled with YARP will create two ports, named:
  ``/ors/services/[component_name]/[service_name]/request`` and
  ``/ors/services/[component_name]/[service_name]/reply``.
  Where [service_name] is a string consisting of ``[component_name]#[service_method]``.

The (ASCII) protocol of the requests is simple::

  id component service "[parameters]"

- ``id`` is a freely chosen request id. It is mainly useful to identify answers
  from asynchronous services.  
- ``component`` is the name of the component you want to invoke the service on.

.. note::
  Services that control the whole simulator belong to the special component ``simulation``.

- ``service``: the name of the request to invoke.
- ``parameters`` (can be omitted if the request takes no argument): request
  arguments. Arguments must be enclosed in brackets, and surrounded by quotes.

MORSE answer follows this model::

  id status [result]

- ``id`` the same id the client used to send the request,
- ``status``: one of the :py:mod:`morse.core.status` constants
- ``result``: a JSON-like result (actually, the representation of the Python
  result object), if any.

Example (sending request on terminal 1)::

  $ yarp write /request /ors/services/Motion_Controller/Motion_Controller#goto/request
  yarp: Port /request active at tcp://140.93.0.93:10173
  yarp: Sending output from /request to /ors/services/Motion_Controller/Motion_Controller#goto/request using tcp
  req1 Motion_Controller goto "[5.0, 4.0, 0.0]"

Example (receiving reply on terminal 2)::

  $ yarp read /reply /ors/services/Motion_Controller/Motion_Controller#goto/reply
  yarp: Port /reply listening at tcp://140.93.0.93:10174
  yarp: Receiving input from /ors/services/Motion_Controller/Motion_Controller#goto/reply to /reply using tcp
  "0 SUCCESS Stop"


The YARP service interface is implemented in :py:mod:`morse.middleware.yarp_request_manager`.



Known problems
--------------

Some blender files will start the simulation fine the first time after opening the
file, but stopping the simulation and starting it again will give this error::

    def open(self, *args): return _yarp.Contactable_open(self, *args)
    NotImplementedError: Wrong number of arguments for overloaded function 'Contactable_open'.

To correct this, it is necessary to open the Blender file, then on a Text
Editor window, select the file ``load_yarp.py``. To the right of the file name,
there is a checkbox named ``Register``. Check this checkbox, save the file, and
open it again. This will ensure that the script ``load_yarp.py`` is read every
time the file is opened, so that yarp is correctly setup before launching the simulation.
